## Toy Robot

A simulator of a toy robot, moving on a tabletop

## Introduction

This console application simulates a toy robot, moving on a tabletop (5x5). The robot can be placed, move, turn (hasn't implemented yet) and report it's location. It cannot fall off the table.
(it reminded me my school days when I started programming and we had so much fun working on similar tasks :) )
